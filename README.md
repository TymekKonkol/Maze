# Maze
Uni project made for subject "basics of programming". Console program made in c/c++. 
Symulates a walkthrough a maze, both from the eagle eye and 1st person view.
Maze can be read from .txt file, also can be edited in a game through editor.
My first big project, so the programming style and coding is poor.
2nd half of 2015.
